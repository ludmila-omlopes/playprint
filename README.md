# filazo

filazo is a game library app built with Next.js 16, React 19, Prisma, and SQLite.
It is designed around a canonical local game catalog that can absorb data from multiple sources:

- Steam account sign-in and owned library sync
- CSV imports for backlog and wishlist exports
- PlayStation NPSSO-based sync for PS4/PS5 purchased games and played trophy titles
- PlayStation CSV imports for library and backlog data
- Xbox Microsoft account sign-in and achievement-history sync
- Xbox CSV imports for library and backlog data
- IGDB metadata enrichment for covers, release dates, platforms, screenshots, and ratings
- HowLongToBeat completion-time enrichment for main story, main + extras, and completionist estimates
- Metacritic metascore enrichment when Steam Store metadata exposes a score
- Optional rule-based and AI-assisted backlog assistance

The current app already includes a landing page, a collector profile, Steam authentication, Steam sync, PlayStation library sync, Xbox authentication and achievement-history sync, CSV mapping/import, and per-game catalog pages.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router
- React 19
- Prisma 6
- SQLite
- Tailwind CSS 4
- JOSE-based signed cookie sessions

## Core Product Model

The app is centered on a canonical `Game` record.

- `Game` stores the normalized catalog entry plus shared IGDB, HLTB, and Metacritic metadata
- `GameProviderLink` links a canonical game to an external provider ID like a Steam app ID
- `UserGameEntry` stores user ownership, wishlist state, playtime, last played date, and completion percentage for a game
- `UserGameInsight` stores per-game assistant signals such as untouched, sampled-dropped, wishlist risk, and release candidates
- `AssistantRun` stores each assistant refresh summary and optional AI output metadata
- `ExternalAccount` stores connected provider accounts like Steam
- PlayStation refresh tokens are encrypted in `ExternalAccount.metadata`; NPSSO values are exchanged and then discarded
- `ImportJob` and `ImportRow` keep an audit trail of CSV imports

This means multiple providers can eventually point to the same internal game instead of creating duplicate records.

## Features

- Steam OpenID sign-in
- Steam owned games sync with playtime, last played date, and achievement-based completion percentages when Steam exposes the data
- PlayStation connection through NPSSO with sync for PS4/PS5 purchased games, played trophy titles, and trophy progress
- Xbox connection through Microsoft OAuth with sync for achievement-history titles, recent title history, and achievement progress
- CSV upload with in-browser column mapping for titles, status, playtime, completion percentage, notes, and external IDs
- PlayStation CSV mode that stores entries as PlayStation provider data and links mapped external IDs through `GameProviderLink`
- Xbox CSV mode that stores entries as Xbox provider data and links mapped external IDs through `GameProviderLink`
- IGDB best-match enrichment during imports and sync
- Best-effort HowLongToBeat enrichment during imports and sync
- Estimated time remaining for user entries when HLTB data and playtime or progress are available
- Best-effort Metacritic score capture for Steam-linked catalog records
- Collector profile page with owned and wishlist sections
- Canonical game detail pages
- Assistant tab with backlog friction insights, play-next picks, release candidates, and buy-decision guidance

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.5+ for the local SQLite bootstrap script
- npm

Optional, depending on what you want to use:

- Steam Web API key for owned library sync
- Microsoft OAuth app credentials for Xbox account sync
- IGDB client credentials for metadata enrichment

PlayStation and Xbox imports use CSV files and do not require credentials.
Xbox account sync requires Microsoft OAuth credentials and uses Xbox achievement/title-history endpoints.
HowLongToBeat enrichment uses an unofficial website-backed lookup and does not require credentials.
Metacritic scores are collected only when public Steam Store app metadata includes a metascore and URL.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in what you need.

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
APP_URL="http://localhost:3001"
AUTH_SECRET="replace-with-a-long-random-string"

# Steam
STEAM_API_KEY=""

# Xbox / Microsoft OAuth
XBOX_CLIENT_ID=""
XBOX_CLIENT_SECRET=""

# IGDB / Twitch
IGDB_CLIENT_ID=""
IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET=""

# Optional AI assistant
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5.4-mini"
```

Notes:

- `AUTH_SECRET` should be a long random string in any non-local environment.
- `DATABASE_URL` is required for catalog features. The default SQLite value is
  intended for local development.
- `STEAM_API_KEY` is required for owned library sync. Steam sign-in itself uses OpenID.
- PlayStation sync does not require an app key. Users provide an NPSSO token in the profile page; the app exchanges it for PlayStation API tokens, stores encrypted refresh/access tokens, and does not store the NPSSO.
- `XBOX_CLIENT_ID` is required for Xbox account sync. Register a Microsoft OAuth app for personal Microsoft accounts and add `${APP_URL}/api/auth/xbox/callback` as a web redirect URI. `XBOX_CLIENT_SECRET` is recommended for web app token exchange.
- Xbox sync stores encrypted Microsoft refresh/access tokens in `ExternalAccount.metadata`. It imports Xbox achievement-history and recent-title-history records, not a guaranteed complete ownership library; Xbox CSV remains the fallback for owned games with no achievement activity.
- IGDB enrichment is optional. If IGDB credentials are missing, the app still works, but imported/synced games stay with local metadata only.
- HowLongToBeat enrichment is optional and best-effort. If the website-backed search is unavailable, imports and Steam sync continue without completion-time estimates.
- Metacritic enrichment is optional and best-effort. If Steam Store app metadata does not expose a Metacritic score, the canonical game keeps an empty metascore.
- The Assistant tab works without AI. If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, the app can use OpenAI's Responses API to recommend three low-friction play-next picks and turn rule-based insights into short explanations. Only library summaries, selected game metadata, progress/playtime signals, source/provider labels, and rule outputs are sent.
- Assistant AI calls are app-gated before hitting OpenAI: unchanged catalog context reuses the latest OpenAI recommendations, otherwise each user is limited to one AI refresh every 10 minutes and 20 AI refreshes per rolling 24 hours, with a 100 AI-refresh rolling daily cap across the app. When a gate blocks AI, the deterministic rules fallback is used.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create `.env` from `.env.example`.

3. Initialize the SQLite database.

```bash
npm run db:init
```

4. Generate the Prisma client if needed.

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

5. Start the dev server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3001`.

## Database Notes

This project currently uses SQLite and includes two database-related pieces:

- [prisma/schema.prisma](./prisma/schema.prisma) as the source Prisma schema
- [scripts/init-db.mjs](./scripts/init-db.mjs) as a direct SQLite bootstrap script

Current scripts:

- `npm run db:init`: creates the SQLite tables and indexes
- `npm run db:push`: currently points to the same bootstrap script
- `npm run db:generate`: generates Prisma Client

Important: `db:push` is not running `prisma db push` right now. It is an alias to the custom bootstrap script. If you later move to Prisma-managed migrations, update this section and the scripts accordingly.

## Vercel Deployment

The public shell can render without a database, but Steam sign-in, profile data,
CSV import, and catalog stats require a reachable production database.

The current `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"` setup is for local development only.
Vercel serverless deployments do not provide durable app-local SQLite storage, so
using the local SQLite file there will either fail at runtime or lose data across
function instances. For a real Vercel deployment, move the Prisma datasource to a
managed database supported by the deployment environment, set `DATABASE_URL`,
run the schema setup for that database, and set these environment variables:

```env
APP_URL="https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app"
AUTH_SECRET="generate-a-long-random-secret"
DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"
```

Optional integrations still degrade independently: missing IGDB credentials only
skip metadata enrichment, and missing `STEAM_API_KEY` only blocks owned-library
sync after Steam sign-in.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: start the Next dev server
- `npm run build`: build for production
- `npm run start`: start the production server
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint
- `npm run db:init`: initialize the SQLite database
- `npm run db:push`: currently same as `db:init`
- `npm run db:generate`: generate Prisma Client

## How the App Works

### Steam flow

1. The user starts at `/api/auth/steam`.
2. The app redirects to Steam OpenID.
3. Steam returns to `/api/auth/steam/callback`.
4. The callback verifies the OpenID response, creates or reuses a local user, stores the Steam account, and sets a signed session cookie.
5. From the profile page, the user can run a Steam sync to fetch owned games and attach them to canonical catalog entries.

### PlayStation flow

1. The user signs in to PlayStation in a browser and retrieves their NPSSO token.
2. The profile page exchanges the NPSSO for PlayStation access and refresh tokens through `psn-api`.
3. The app stores encrypted PlayStation API tokens in `ExternalAccount.metadata` and discards the NPSSO.
4. From the profile page, the user can sync PS4/PS5 purchased games through `getPurchasedGames` and played trophy titles through `getUserTitles`.
5. Each title is attached to a canonical `Game` with `PLAYSTATION` `GameProviderLink` records keyed by available IDs such as `titleId`, `productId`, `conceptId`, `entitlementId`, and `npCommunicationId`.
6. Trophy progress is stored as `UserGameEntry.completionPercent` when PSN exposes it.

### Xbox flow

1. The user starts at `/api/auth/xbox`.
2. The app redirects to Microsoft OAuth with `Xboxlive.signin` and `Xboxlive.offline_access` scopes.
3. Microsoft returns to `/api/auth/xbox/callback`.
4. The callback exchanges the authorization code for Microsoft OAuth tokens, then exchanges those for Xbox Live user and XSTS tokens.
5. The app stores encrypted Microsoft OAuth tokens in `ExternalAccount.metadata`; short-lived Xbox Live/XSTS tokens are regenerated during sync.
6. From the profile page, the user can sync Xbox achievement-history titles and recent title history.
7. Each title is attached to a canonical `Game` with `XBOX` `GameProviderLink` records keyed by available IDs such as `titleId`, `scid`, and `pfn`.
8. Achievement progress is stored as `UserGameEntry.completionPercent` when Xbox exposes enough achievement or gamerscore data.

### CSV, PlayStation, and Xbox import flow

1. The user uploads a CSV on the profile page.
2. The browser parses the file and shows a source selector plus column-mapping UI.
3. A server action receives the raw CSV plus selected mappings.
4. Each row is normalized into a canonical game resolution attempt.
5. When PlayStation CSV is selected, `UserGameEntry.provider` is set to `PLAYSTATION`, the platform defaults to PlayStation when no platform column is mapped, and any mapped external ID is stored as a PlayStation `GameProviderLink`.
6. When Xbox CSV is selected, `UserGameEntry.provider` is set to `XBOX`, the platform defaults to Xbox when no platform column is mapped, and any mapped external ID is stored as an Xbox `GameProviderLink`.
7. Import results are recorded in `ImportJob` and `ImportRow`.

### Catalog resolution

Whenever a game comes from Steam, PlayStation sync, Xbox sync, generic CSV, PlayStation CSV, or Xbox CSV:

1. The app checks for an existing provider link when a provider ID is available.
2. It checks for an existing game by normalized title.
3. It tries to enrich the record with IGDB and HowLongToBeat.
4. It creates or updates the canonical `Game`.
5. It links external provider IDs, including HLTB IDs when available, through `GameProviderLink`.
6. It stores the user-facing entry in `UserGameEntry`.

Steam sync stores `lastPlayedAt` from Steam's `rtime_last_played` field when Steam returns it. It also tries to calculate `completionPercent` from achievements by comparing unlocked achievements to the total achievements returned for each app. Both are best-effort: games without last-played data or Steam achievements, private or blocked stats, and temporary API failures are left untracked.

HowLongToBeat stores completion estimates on the canonical `Game` as minutes and links the HLTB game ID through `GameProviderLink`. HLTB does not expose an official public API, so failures or search misses are ignored instead of blocking catalog resolution. User entries estimate remaining time from the default HLTB target, preferring main + extras, then main story, then completionist; completion percentage is used first, otherwise recorded playtime is subtracted.

Metacritic stores the critic metascore on the canonical `Game` and links the Metacritic URL through `GameProviderLink` when Steam Store metadata provides it. This avoids scraping Metacritic directly and keeps missing scores non-blocking.

### Assistant flow

1. The user opens `/profile?tab=assistant`.
2. A server action refreshes deterministic insights from `UserGameEntry` data such as status, playtime, last played date, completion, favorites, and genres.
3. Insights are stored in `UserGameInsight`; each `AssistantRun` keeps a compact audit trail of the input summary and output summary.
4. Before calling OpenAI, the app reuses the latest OpenAI recommendations when the relevant catalog context has not changed. Otherwise it enforces a 10-minute per-user cooldown, a 20-per-user rolling daily limit, and a 100-per-app rolling daily limit.
5. If OpenAI credentials are configured and the AI gate allows the refresh, the app asks for structured play-next recommendations from the user's catalog and a structured explanation. If the request fails, credentials are missing, or a limit is reached, deterministic fallback picks and text are used.
6. The buy-decision helper compares a candidate title against owned/wishlist/backlog patterns and returns buy, wait, wishlist, or skip guidance.

## Current Rough Edges

- The repository still contains starter-project leftovers that have not all been cleaned up.
- The current README was replaced from the default template, but surrounding contributor docs may still need tightening.
- ESLint currently reports warnings for raw `<img>` usage on catalog pages.
- There are uncommitted local changes in the repository.

## Linting

Run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

At the time of writing, lint passes with warnings only. The active warnings are the standard Next.js `no-img-element` warnings for image rendering.

## Next Steps

Likely next improvements for the product:

- replace raw image tags with `next/image` where appropriate
- add tests around catalog resolution and import behavior
- decide whether database initialization should stay custom or move fully to Prisma migrations
- document deployment and production environment expectations
- expand provider support beyond Steam
